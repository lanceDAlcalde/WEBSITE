        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 head peeled and minced</li>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce</li>

        </ul>

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Trim chicken feet of nails and any dark, callused areas. Scrub well with salt, rinse in cold water, and drain well.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring about 2 liters of water to a boil. Add chicken feet and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain well, discarding liquid.</li>
        <li>In a pot, combine chicken feet, 2 cups, water, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, onions, peppercorns, and bay leaves,</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, uncovered and without stirring, for about 3 to 5 minutes. Lower heat, cover, and continue to cook until skin of feet begins to break and liquid is reduced.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and drain, reserving liquid.</li>
        <li>In a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil. Add the chicken feet including aromatics and cook, stirring regularly, for about 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add reserved liquid and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer until very tender (skin will begin to peel off from bones) and sauce is reduced.</li>
        <li>Add chili garlic sauce and season with salt to taste. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Parboil the chicken feet first to remove any excess protein and impurities.</li>
        <li>Add chili garlic sauce for a hint of spice. You can substitute minced Thai chili peppers.</li>
        <li>The sauce will congeal when cold due to the gelatin content from the bones.</li>
        </ul>
