        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>3 pounds bone-in beef shanks</li>
        <li>cold water</li>
        <li>1 large onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 corn, husked and cut into halves</li>
        <li>1 bunch pechay, leaves separated</li>
        <li>2 green onions, stemmed and cut into halves</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>

        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, combine beef shanks and enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Drain beef and rinse under cold water to remove impurities. Discard the liquid and rinse the pot.</li>
        <li>In the pot, return meat and enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
        <li>When the broth has cleared, add onions, fish sauce, and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover, and cook at a bare simmer for <br>about 1 Â½ to 2 hours or until meat is fork-tender but not falling apart.</li>
        <li>Add corn and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until corn is tender.</li>
        <li>Add the pechay and green onions and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste. Serve hot with fish sauce and calamansi.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Start with cold water. The higher initial temperature of hot water draws more protein from the meat and bones, creating a cloudy broth. <br>Hot water also has more dissolved minerals from the pipes, which can add an off taste to the soup.</li>
        <li>Cook at a simmer.  Rapid boiling may cause agitation that can cloud the broth. Low and<Br> slow cooking allows flavors in the dish to develop and become concentrated.</li>
        </ul>
