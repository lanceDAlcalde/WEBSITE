        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add potatoes and carrots and cook, turning once or twice until lightly browned.<Br>
             Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. </li>
        <li>Remove oil from the pan except for about 2 tablespoons. Add bell peppers and cook for<Br>
             about 30 to 45 seconds. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high heat. Add beef and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes or <br>
            until lightly browned. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil if needed. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring regularly until softened.</li>
        <li>Add beef.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, water, and tomato paste. Stir until well distributed and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover, and cook for about 1 ½ to 2 hours or until beef is tender.  Add more water in ½ cup increments as needed<Br>
             if the sauce is drying out before the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and carrots and continue to cook for about 4 to 5 minutes or until vegetables <br>
            are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened and reduced as desired. </li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and cook for about 1 minute or until tender yet crisp.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Cut the ingredients in uniform sizes for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Pat the beef dry with paper towels, as the excess moisture will create steam and keep the meat from developing a caramelized crust.</li>
        <li>Sear the beef properly. Brown on medium-high heat, and do not overcrowd the pan. Be patient and give<br>
             the meat time to sear before turning.</li>
        
        </ul>
