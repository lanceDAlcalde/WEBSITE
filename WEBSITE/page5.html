        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a saucepot, arrange the chicken in a single layer. Add water, quartered onions, smashed garlic cloves, ginger, salt, and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and cook in barely a simmer for about 15 minutes or until thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken reads 165 F.</li>
        <li>With a slotted spoon, remove chicken from pot and allow to cool to touch. Coarsely shred chicken and keep warm. Discard bones.</li>
        <li>Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain liquid. Discard aromatics and reserve 4 cups of the broth.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stand an ear of corn up and using a small knife, thinly cut the kernels off from top to bottom. <br>Rotate the corn when done with each section to get to the next. Scrape the sides of the cobs using a spoon to extract the remaining pulp and milky juice.</li>
        <li>Add corn and soy sauce to the pot. Cook for medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add chicken.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 teaspoons of the cornstarch with ¼ cup water. Stir until dissolved and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add cornstarch slurry to the pot, whisking vigorously to prevent lumps. Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Lower heat to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine eggs and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Whisk together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle the egg mixture into the soup and let stand for 15 seconds and then stir gently stir to break up.</li>
        <li>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into servings bowls and sprinkle with green onions. Serve hot.</li>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The recipe calls for fresh white corn. Feel free to swap with canned corn kernels to skip the shucking and slicing. <br>If you want to use creamed corn, adjust the amount of cornstarch slurry.</li>
        <li>Season with soy sauce to add a salty, umami taste. You can also use fish sauce.
            Whisk a little bit of cornstarch to the eggs before adding to the soup. <br>This is to protect the eggs from seizing in the high heat so they'll soft and velvety.</li>
        </ul>
