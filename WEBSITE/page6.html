        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil. Add potatoes and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned and tender. <br>Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Add carrots and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Remove excess oil from pan except for about 1 tablespoon. Add bell peppers and cook for about 30 to 40 seconds. Remove from pan and set aside. </li>
        <li>Add onions, garlic, and ginger and cook until softened. </li>
        <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and continue to cook for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk and water. Bring to a simmer, skimming any scum that may float on top.</li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and carrots and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add curry powder and stir to combine. Continue to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until sauce starts to thicken. </li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and cook for about 1 minute or until tender yet crisp. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>For a smooth and creamy sauce, do not bring it to a rapid boil and cook at a gentle simmer lest the coconut milk curdles and separate.</li>
        <li>Once the curry powder is added, give the sauce a few minutes to slow cook to allow the spices to release their flavors.</li>
        <li>Prefer a thicker consistency? Simmer uncovered so the excess liquid evaporates quickly and the sauce reduces without overcooking the meat and vegetables.</li>
        </ul>
