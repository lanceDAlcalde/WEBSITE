        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef shanks, bone-in</li>
        <li>1 pound beef tendons</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>1 large onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 corn, husked and cut into halves</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 small cabbage, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>12 green beans, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>green onions, optional</li>

        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a pot, combine beef shanks, beef tendon, and water. Over medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top.</li>
        <li>When clear of froth, add onions, peppercorns, and fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover and cook at no more than a simmer for about 2 to 2 Â½ hours or until shanks are tender and<br> tendons are soft. Add more water as needed during cooking to maintain about 6 to 7 cups.</li>
        <li>Add corn and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes and cook for about 5 minutes or until almost tender.</li>
        <li>Add green beans and cabbage and cook for another 2 to 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender yet crisp.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste. Ladle into serving bowls and garnish with chopped green onions, if desired. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Since beef tendons are tough and fibrous connective tissues, they are almost impossible to cut uncooked. Ask butcher to slice tendons into pieces or halfway during <br>
            cooking and when tendons are soft enough to slice through, remove from pot, cut into serving parts and then return to pot to continue to cook.</li>
