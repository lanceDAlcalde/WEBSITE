        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Peel and/or cut away the dark, fibrous parts of the lemongrass until you get to the white and light green portions.<Br> Using a knife, finely chop lemongrass.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine vinegar, calamansi juice, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, sugar, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well-blended.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and cover bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator for at 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>In a wide pan over medium heat, place chicken fat and cook, turning as needed, until crisp and renders oil.<Br> Using a slotted spoon, remove skin and bottoms.</li>
        <li>Lower heat and add annatto seeds, crushed garlic, and bay leaf. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes, turning as needed to prevent seeds from burning.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and allow the oil to steep for about 1 hour or until oil is infused with deep orange color.<br> Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain oil. Discard aromatics and set aside oil.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease grill grates and heat over hot coals.</li>
        <li>Drain chicken from marinade and scrape off any stray aromatics. Arrange chicken in a single layer over hot grates with skin side up.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken, turning once or twice and basting regularly with the half of the chicken oil, <Br>for about 30 to 40 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken registers 160 F.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, cover, and allow to rest for about 3 to 5 minutes. Serve hot with the remaining chicken oil and steamed rice.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Use a non-reactive bowl or resealable bags to marinate the chicken.</li>
        <li>Marinate for at least two hours up or overnight for the best results. Do not keep the chicken in the marinade for <br>more than 8 hours lest the vinegar and citrus juice acids denature the proteins and turn the meat mushy.</li>
        </ul>
