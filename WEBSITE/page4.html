        <li>In a deep pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until it loses its pink. Lower heat, cover, and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken releases its juices.</li>
        <li>Raise heat to high and add boiling water. Add carrots, celery, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Season with salt. Skim scum that accumulates on top.</li>
        <li>Lower heat again and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>With a slotted spoon, remove chicken pieces from broth. Allow to cool to touch. Remove meat from bones and shred. Set aside chicken meat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Return the bones to the pot and continue to cook at barely a simmer, uncovered, for about 30 to 40 minutes or until slightly reduced and the flavor is concentrated.</li>
        <li>Using a cheesecloth, strain liquid and discard bones and aromatics.</li>
        <li>Return the broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Season with fish sauce to taste.</li>
